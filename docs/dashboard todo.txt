dashboard todo

	- fetch git statuses in background interval w cache
	
dashboard todo later

	- make git status event driven via hooks
		- post-commit, post-checkout, post-merge hooks write to a status table
		- Dashboard reads the table, never spawns git processes
		- Strap could install these hooks on strap adopt - fits perfectly with the architecture
		- Near-zero overhead, always current
